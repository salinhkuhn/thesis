\chaptre {Peephole Rewriting Pass}
After a LLVM IR program passes the instruction selection pipeline, they code can contain inefficient introduced due to the lowering. Lowering from target independent LLVM IR into a targrt-agnostic machine language also provides new capabilities to use the target specific instructions and their semantics to leverage optimization capabilities. 

To optimize our code produced by the instruction selector, we have implemented peephole rewrites that are employed in the GCC backend and operate both on GCC's high-level and lower-level IR. Our implementation covers all the peephole rewrites defined in the gcc match.pd file which is consumed by the GGC code generator to output pattern-matching code for GCC high- and low-level IR.
